# switch_grid

switch_grid is two jQuery plug-ins that make it easy to create toggle switches and define their behavior.

The first, **toggle_switch.js**, is used to build simple 'on-off' switches and set their positions.

For simple 'on-off' toggling **toggle_switch.js** is perfectly adequate, but if switch positions are coupled together, for example if one switch should always be toggled on when another switch is toggled on, **switch_grid.js** can be used.
